On the first day at youcode, I meet our formateur and our classmate 
we did a stand-up presentation & last was git and Github.

<what did I learn>
I learned how to do public speaking and also took some tips about it from formateur 
and I learn about méthode scrum that YouCode use and how to install git & create Github 
account and I knew a lot of information about my classmates.

Of course what I learned this  day can help and will in the future  
like speaking at some interview or doing public speaking without talking 
about the importance of git & Github in my future projects .

<how it will help>
all that will lead to self-education that  also will  lead to self-development
without any boundaries,

<what did I see>
today was all about live coding  and we also talked  about the algorithm history and  the big O nation of algorithm  algorithm uses

i learned a lot of things from today class because the live coding we did and how deal with the problemes we counter 
and a lot of question has been  asked and answered form both the teacher and student after lunch my classmate did  presentaion
contain history and the structure of algorithm and also, talk about linear search and binary search algorithm


<how it will help>

the presentaion also give a lot of information about algoritm .
